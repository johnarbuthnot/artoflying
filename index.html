            <p class="headline">A Treatise of the Art of Polítical Lying</p>
            <i style="text-align: justify;">Written 300 years ago, this text offers a brilliant and darkly comic look at the politics of lying in a fledgling democracy. It’s fascinating how the author’s analysis of political deception could easily apply to today’s world in 2025. While the specifics of the political landscape have changed, the core tactics remain disturbingly similar: manipulating public opinion, crafting narratives, and spinning truths to serve those in power. In a time where misinformation spreads faster than ever—through social media, news outlets, and even political campaigns—the text’s warning about the dangers of believing our own lies feels more relevant than ever. The public's relationship with truth remains as complicated and fragile as it was in early democratic Britain.</i>

                The Author, in his Preface, makes some very judicious Reflexions upon the Original of Arts and
                Sciences; that at first they consist of scattered
                Theorems and Practices, which are handed about
                among the Masters, and only revealed to the Filii
                Artis, till such time as some great Genius appears,
                who collects these disjointed propositions, and reduces them into a regular System. That this is the
                Case
                of that <strong>Noble and Useful Art of Political Lying</strong>, which
                in this last Age having been enriched with several new
                Discoveries, ought not to Lye any longer in Rubbish
                and Confusion, but may justly claim a place in the
                Encyclopaedia, especially such as serves for a Model
                of Education for an able Politician; That he propases
                to himself no small Stock of Fame in future Ages, in
                being the first who has undertaken this Design; and
                for the same Reason he hopes the Imperfection of his
                Work will be excused. He invites all Persons who
                have any Talents that way, or any new Discovery, to
                communicate their Thoughts, assuring them that
                honourable mention shall be made of them in his
                Work.

                In his preface, the author makes insightful reflections on the origins of arts and sciences. He observes
                that, at first, they consist of scattered theorems and practices, passed among masters and revealed only
                to the <em>Filii Artis</em> (sons of the art), until a great genius emerges to collect these disjointed
                propositions and organize them into a coherent system. This, he argues, is the case with the
                <strong>Noble and Useful Art of Political Lying</strong>. In recent times, this art has been enriched
                with several new discoveries and should no longer remain in disorder and confusion. Instead, it deserves
                a proper place in the encyclopedias, particularly those designed as models for training skilled
                politicians.<br>
                The author anticipates earning considerable fame in future ages as the first to undertake this project.
                For this reason, he hopes any imperfections in his work will be excused. He invites all individuals with
                talents in this field, or those who have made any new discoveries, to share their ideas with him,
                assuring them that they will receive honorable mention in his work.

            <p class="ye_olde">The First Volume consists of Eleven Chapters.
                In the first Chapter of his excellent Treatise he reasons Philosophically conceming the Nature of the
                Soul of Man, and those Qualities which render it susceptible of Lyes. He supposes the Soul to be of the
                Nature of a Plano-Cylindrical Speculum, or Looking-glass; that the plain side was mude by God Almighty,
                but that the Devil afterwards wrought the other side
                into a Cylindrical Figure. The plain side represents
                Objects just as they are; and the Cylindrical side, by
                the Rules of Catoptricks, must needs represent true
                Objects false, and false Objects true; but the
                Cylindrical side being much the larger Surface, takes
                in a greater Compass of visual Rays. That upon the
                Cylindrical side of the Soul of Man depends the
                whole Art and Success of Political Lying.
            </p>
            <p class="actual_slang">
                The first volume consists of eleven chapters. In the first chapter of this excellent treatise, the
                author philosophically examines the nature of the human soul and the qualities that make it susceptible
                to lies. He proposes that the soul resembles a plano-cylindrical mirror or looking-glass. The plain
                side, he suggests, was created by God, while the Devil later shaped the other side into a cylindrical
                form.<br>
                The plain side reflects objects as they truly are, while the cylindrical side, according to the
                principles of catoptrics, necessarily distorts reality: it reflects true objects as false and false
                objects as true. Since the cylindrical side is much larger in surface area, it captures a greater range
                of visual rays. The author argues that the entire art and success of political lying depends upon this
                cylindrical side of the human soul.

            <p class="ye_olde">The
                Author, in this Chapter, proceeds to reason upon the Qualities of the Mind: as, its great Fondness of
                the
                Malicious and the Miraculous. The Tendency of the
                Soul toward the Malicious, springs from Self-love, or
                a pleasure to find Mankind more wicked, base, or
                unfortunate than ourselves. The Design of the
                Miraculous proceeds from the Inactivity of the Soul,
                or its Incapacity to be movedor delighted with anything that is vulgar or common. The Author having
                establishd the Qualities of the Mind, upon which his
                Art is founded, he proceeds,
                In his Second Chapter, to treat of the nature of
                Political Lying; which he defines to be, the Art of
                convincing the People of Salutary Falshoods, for
                some good End. He calls it an Art to distinguish it
                from that of telling Truth, which does not seem to
                want Art; but then he would have this understood
                only as to the invention, because there is indeed more
                Art necessary to convince the People of a Salutary
                Truth than a Salutary Falshood. Then he proceeds to
                prove that there are Salutary Falshoods, of which he
                gives a great many Instances, both before and after
                the Revolution; and demonstrates plainly, that we
                could not have carried on the War so long without
                several of those Salutary Falshoods. He gives Rules
                to calculate the Value of a Political Lye, in Pounds,
                Shillings, and Pence. By Good, he does not mean that which is absolutely so, but what appears so to the
                Artist which is a sufficient Ground for him to proceed upon; and he distinguishes the Good, as it
                comonly
                is, into Bonum utile, Dulce & Honestum. He
                shews you that there are Política! Lyes of a mixed
                nature, which include all the Three in different respects : that the Utile reigns generally about the
                Exchange, the Dulce and Honestum at the
                Westminster End of the Town. One Man spreads a
                Lye to sell or Buy Stock to greater Advantage; a
                second, because it is honourable to serve his Party;
                anda third, because it is sweet to gratify his Revenge.
                Having explained the severa! Terms of his Dcfinition,
                he proceeds,
                In his Third Chapter, to treat of the Lawfulness of
                Political Lying; which he deduces from its true and
                genuine Principies, by inquiring into the severa!
                Rights that Mankind have to Truth. He shows that
                People have a Right to prívate Truth from their
                Neighbours, and Economical Truth from their own
                Family; that they should not be abused by their
                Wives, Children, and Servants; but, that they have no
                Right at all to Political Truth: That the People may as
                well all pretend to be Lords of Manors. and possess
                great Estates. as to have Truth told them in matters of
                Government. The Author, with great Judgment. states the severa! Shares of Mankind in this matter of
                Truth,
                according to their severa! Capacities, Dignities, and
                Professions; and shews you, that Children have
                hardly any share at al!; in consequence of which, they
                have very seldom any Truth told them. It must be
                owned that the Author, in this Chapter, has some seeming Difficulties to answer, to explain texts of
                Scripture, and a Sermon lately preached befare Her
                Majesty at Windsor.

            </p>
            <p class="actual_slang">
                The author, in this chapter, proceeds to reason about the qualities of the human mind, particularly its
                fondness for the malicious and the miraculous. He explains that the mind’s tendency toward the malicious
                arises from self-love, or the pleasure we derive in perceiving others as more wicked, base, or
                unfortunate than ourselves. The desire for the miraculous, on the other hand, stems from the inactivity
                of the soul, or its inability to be moved or delighted by anything ordinary or common.<br>
                Having established these qualities of the mind upon which his art is founded, the author continues in
                his second chapter to discuss the nature of political lying. He defines political lying as the art of
                convincing people of beneficial falsehoods for a greater good. He calls it an "art" to distinguish it
                from telling the truth, which, he argues, requires no skill. However, he clarifies that this applies
                only to the invention of lies, since, in practice, it often requires more effort to convince the public
                of a beneficial truth than a beneficial lie.<br>
                The author goes on to prove the existence of such "beneficial falsehoods" and provides numerous examples
                both before and after the Revolution. He argues plainly that the war could not have been sustained for
                so long without employing several of these falsehoods. To further illustrate his point, he provides
                rules for calculating the value of a political lie in pounds, shillings, and pence. By “good,” he does
                not mean what is absolutely good, but what appears good to the political artist—a justification he
                considers sufficient. He divides the concept of "good" into three categories: the useful (<em>Bonum
                    Utile</em>), the pleasant (<em>Dulce</em>), and the honorable (<em>Honestum</em>).<br>
                The author explains that political lies often combine all three elements in varying proportions: the
                useful generally reigns near the financial Exchange, while the pleasant and honorable are more prevalent
                at Westminster. For instance, one man might spread a lie to manipulate stock prices for profit, another
                out of honor to serve his political party, and yet another to satisfy the sweet pleasure of revenge.<br>
                Having defined and categorized political lying, the author proceeds in his third chapter to address its
                lawfulness. He traces this question back to fundamental principles and explores the various rights
                humanity has to truth. He argues that individuals have a right to private truth from their neighbors and
                domestic truth within their families, where they should not be deceived by wives, children, or servants.
                However, he insists that the public has no right at all to political truth, comparing such a claim to
                common people demanding ownership of manors or vast estates.<br>
                With great judgment, the author allocates humanity’s share in truth according to their capacities,
                ranks, and professions. He observes that children, for instance, have virtually no share in truth at
                all, which explains why they are so rarely told the truth. The author acknowledges that this chapter
                poses some challenges, including addressing certain passages from Scripture and explaining a sermon
                recently preached before Her Majesty at Windsor.
            </p>





            <p class="ye_olde">
                The Fourth Chapter is wholly employed in this
                question, Whether the Right of Coinage of political
                lyes be wholly in the Govemment. The Author, who
                is a true Friend to English Liberty, determines in the
                Negative, and answers all the Arguments of the opposite Pat1y with great Acuteness: that, as the
                govemment of England has a mixture of Democratical in it,
                so the Right of Inventing and Spreading Political
                Lyes is partly in the People; and their obstinate
                Adherence to this just Privilege has been most conspicuous, and shined with great Lustre of late Years:
                That it happens very often, that there are no other
                Means left to the good People of England to pull
                down a Ministry and Govemment they are weary of,
                but by exercising this their undoubted Right: that
                Abundance of Política! Lying is a sure sign of true
                English Liberty: that as ministers do sometimes use
                Tools to support their Power, it is but reasonable that
                the People should employ the same Weapon to
                defend themselves, and pul! them down.
                In his tifth Chapter, he divides Political Lyes into
                their severa! Species and Classes, and gives Precepts
                about the Inventing, Spreading, and Propagating the
                severa! sorts of them: He begins with the Rumores,
                and Libelli famosi, such as concem the Reputation of
                men in Power; where he tinds Fault with the common Mistake, that takes Notice only of one sort, viz. the
                Detractory or Defamatory; whereas in truth there are
                three sorts, the Detractory, the Additory, and the
                Translatory.

            </p>

                The fourth chapter is devoted entirely to the question of whether the exclusive right to coin political
                lies belongs to the government. The author, being a staunch advocate of English liberty, firmly argues
                against this notion and counters all opposing arguments with remarkable sharpness. He asserts that, as
                the government of England contains a democratic element, the right to invent and spread political lies
                is partly vested in the people. He highlights that the people’s steadfast commitment to this rightful
                privilege has recently shone with great distinction.<br>
                The author contends that, often, the only means left for the good people of England to overthrow a
                ministry or government they have grown weary of is by exercising this undeniable right. He even goes so
                far as to declare that an abundance of political lying is a clear indicator of true English liberty. He
                argues that, just as ministers sometimes use underhanded methods to maintain their power, it is only
                fair that the people employ similar tools to defend themselves and bring those ministers down.<br>
                In the fifth chapter, the author categorizes political lies into their various species and classes,
                offering detailed instructions on how to invent, spread, and propagate each type. He begins with
                <em>rumores</em> (rumors) and <em>libelli famosi</em> (scandalous pamphlets), particularly those aimed
                at tarnishing the reputations of people in power. He critiques the common misconception of focusing only
                on defamatory lies, pointing out that there are actually three distinct types: the detractory
                (defamatory), the additory (exaggerative), and the translatory (misleading or shifting context).
            </p>




            <p class="ye_olde">
                The Additory gives to a Great Man a larger share of Reputation than belongs to him, to
                enable him to serve some good End or Purpose. The
                Detractory, or Defamatory, is a Lye which takes from
                a Great Man the Reputation that justly belongs to
                him, for fear he should use it to the Detriment of the
                Publick. The Translatory is a Lye, that a transfers the
                Merit of a Mans good Action to another, who is in
                himself more deserving; or transfers the Demerit of a
                bad Action from the true Author toa Person who is in
                himself less deserving. He gives severa! Instances of
                very great Strokes in all the Three Kinds, especially
                in the last, when it was necessary for the Good of the
                Publick to bestow the Valour and Conduct of one
                Man upon another, and that of many to one Man: nay,
                even upon a good Occasion, a Man may be robed of
                his Victory by a Person that did not Command in the
                Action. The Restoring and Destroying the Publick
                may be ascribed to Persons who had no hand in either.
                The Author exhorts all Gentlemen Practitioners to
                exercise themselves in the Translatory, because the
                Existence ofthe Things themselves being visible, and
                not demanding any Proof, there wants nothing to be
                put upon the Publick, but a false Author, or a false Cause, which is no great Presumption upon the
                Credulity of Mankind, to whom the secret Springs of
                things are for the most part unknown.

                The <em>additory</em> lie grants a great man a larger share of reputation than he truly deserves,
                enabling him to serve a beneficial purpose or achieve a good end. The <em>detractory</em> (or
                defamatory) lie, on the other hand, takes away the rightful reputation of a great man to prevent him
                from using it to harm the public. The <em>translatory</em> lie is one that shifts the merit of a
                person’s good action to someone more deserving or transfers the blame of a bad action from the true
                wrongdoer to someone less deserving.<br>
                The author provides several examples of striking instances in all three types, particularly in the case
                of the translatory lie, when it was necessary for the public good to attribute the valor and leadership
                of one man to another, or even to attribute the deeds of many individuals to a single person. In some
                cases, a man’s victory may be claimed by someone who did not even command during the action. Likewise,
                actions that restore or harm the public can be wrongly credited to individuals who had no involvement in
                them.<br>
                The author encourages all gentlemen practitioners to focus on mastering the translatory lie, as the
                existence of the events in question is generally visible and does not require proof. The only thing
                needed to deceive the public is a false attribution—whether a fabricated author or a false cause—which
                is hardly a great stretch given that the true forces behind events are often unknown to most people.

            <p class="ye_olde">The Author proceeds to give some Precepts as to the
                Additory. That when one ascribes any thing to a
                Person which does not belong to him, the Lye ought
                to be calculated not quite contradictory to his known
                qualities; Ex. gr. One would not make the French king
                present at a Protestant Conventicle; nor, like Queen
                Elizabeth, restare the Overplus of Taxes to her
                Subjects. One would not bring in the Emperor giving
                two Months Pay in Advance to his Troops; nor the
                Dutch paying more than their Quota. One would not
                make the same Person zealous for a Standing Army,
                and Publick Liberty; nor an Atheist support the
                Church; nor a lewd Fellow a Reformer of Manners;
                nora hot-headed, crack-brained Coxcomb forward for
                a Scheme of Moderation. But, if it is absolutely
                necessary that a Person is to have some good adventitious Quality given him, the Authors Precept is,
                that it
                should not be done at first in extremo gradu. For
                Example: they should not make a covetous Man give
                away al! at once Five thousand Pounds in a charitable,
                generous way; Twenty or Thirty may suffice at first.
                They should not introduce a Person of remarkable
                Ingratitude to his Benefactors, rewarding a poor Man for some good Office that was done him thirty Years
                ago; but they may allow him to acknowledge a
                Service to a Person who is capable still to do him
                another. AMan whose personal Courage is suspected,
                is not at first to drive whole Squadrons befare him;
                but he may be allowd the merit of some Squabble, or
                throwing a Bottle at his Adversary's head.
                It will not be allowed to make a Great Man that is a
                known Despiser of Religion spend whole Days in his
                Closet at his Devotion; but, you may with Safety
                make him sit out publick Prayers with Decency. A
                Great Man, who has never been known willingly to
                pay a just Debt, ought not all of a sudden to be introduced making restitution of Thousands he has
                cheated; let it suftice at first, to pay Twenty Pounds to a
                friend who has lost his Note.
            </p>
            <p class="actual_slang">
                The author proceeds to give some guidelines on the <em>additory</em> lie. When attributing something to
                a person that doesn't belong to them, the lie should not be entirely contradictory to their known
                characteristics. For example, one would not depict the French king attending a Protestant gathering, nor
                would one have Queen Elizabeth return excess taxes to her subjects. Likewise, one would not have the
                emperor give two months’ pay in advance to his troops, nor would the Dutch be portrayed as paying more
                than their fair share. One should not make the same person both a strong supporter of a standing army
                and of public liberty, nor should an atheist be shown supporting the church, or a dissolute person
                portrayed as a reformer of morals. Nor should an imprudent, reckless fool be presented as a champion of
                moderation.<br>
                However, if it is absolutely necessary to assign a person some positive, unexpected quality, the author
                advises that it should not be done excessively at first. For example, one should not make a miser give
                away five thousand pounds all at once in a charitable act; a gift of twenty or thirty pounds would
                suffice initially. Similarly, one should not have a person who has been notably ungrateful to his
                benefactors reward a poor man for a good deed done decades ago, but it is acceptable for him to
                acknowledge a service to someone still in a position to help him. A man suspected of lacking personal
                courage should not immediately be depicted leading entire squadrons into battle; instead, he may be
                credited with a small altercation, such as throwing a bottle at his adversary’s head.<br>
                It would not be plausible to have a great man, known for despising religion, spend whole days in devout
                prayer; however, it is acceptable to show him attending public prayers with decency. Similarly, a great
                man known for never willingly paying his debts should not suddenly be portrayed making restitution for
                thousands of pounds he has cheated others out of. It would be sufficient to have him pay back twenty
                pounds to a friend who has lost his note.

            <p class="ye_olde">He lays down the same Rules in the Detractory or
                Defamatory kind; that they should not be quite opposite to the Qualities the Persons are supposed to
                have.
                Thus it will not be found, according to the sound
                Rules of Pseudology to repmt of a pious and religious
                Prince that he neglects his Devotion, and would introduce Heresy; but you may report of a merciful
                Prince,
                that he has Pardoned a Criminal who did not deserve
                it. You will be unsuccessful if you give out of a Great
                Man, who is remarkable for his Frugality for the
                PLiblick, that he squanders away the Nation's Money;
                but you may safely relate that he hoards it: You must
                not atfirm he took a Bribe, but you may freely censure him for being tardy in his Payments; because,
                though neither may be true, yet the last is credible,
                the first not. Of an open-hearted, generous Minister,
                you are not to say, that he was in an Intrigue to Betray
                his Country; but you may affirm with some probability, that he was in an Intrigue with a Lady. He wams
                all Practitioners to take good heed to these Precepts
                for want of which Many of their Lyes of late have
                proved abortive or short-lived.

                He lays down the same rules for the <em>detractory</em> or <em>defamatory</em> lie: they should not
                directly contradict the qualities the person is assumed to have. For example, it would not be
                appropriate, according to the sound principles of pseudology, to accuse a pious and religious prince of
                neglecting his devotion and promoting heresy. However, one may report that a merciful prince pardoned a
                criminal who did not deserve it. Similarly, it would not be wise to claim that a great man, known for
                his frugality in public matters, squanders the nation’s money. But it is safe to say that he hoards it.
                One must not state that he took a bribe, but it is acceptable to criticize him for being slow in making
                payments because, though neither may be true, the latter is more plausible, while the former is not. For
                an open-hearted, generous minister, it would be unwise to claim that he was involved in a conspiracy to
                betray the country, but one may reasonably assert that he was involved in an affair with a lady. He
                warns all practitioners to be mindful of these precepts, as many lies recently have been unsuccessful or
                short-lived due to a lack of adherence to these guidelines.

            <p class="ye_olde">In the Sixth Chapter, he treats of the Miraculous; by
                which he understands any thing that exceeds the common Degrees of Probability. In respect of the People,
                it is divided into two sorts, the Ominous Lye or Terrifying Lie, and Animating or Encouraging
                Lie, both being extremely useful on their proper
                Occasions. Concerning the Ominous Lye, he gives several
                Rules; one of which is, that terrible Objects should
                not be too frequently shewn to the People, lest they
                grow familiar. He says, it is absolutely necessary that
                the People of England should be frighted with the
                French King and the Pretender once a-Year; but that
                the Bears should be chained up again till that time
                Twelve-month. The want of Observing this so necessary a Precept, in bringing out the Raw-head and
                Bloody-bones upon every trifling Occasion, has produced great Indifference in the Vulgar of late Years.
                As
                to the Animating or Encouraging Lyes, he gives the
                following Rules: That they shall not far exceed the
                common degrees of Probability, and that there should
                be variety of them, and the same Lye not obstinately
                insisted upon: that the Promissory or Prognosticating
                Lyes should not be upon short Days, for fear the
                Authors should ha ve the Shame and Confusion to see
                themselves speedily contradicted. He examines, by
                these Rules, that well-meant, but unfortunate Lye of
                the Conquest of France which continued near twenty
                Years together; but at last, by being too obstinately
                insisted upon, it was wom threadbare, and became
                unsuccessful.

                In the Sixth Chapter, he discusses the Miraculous, which he defines as anything that exceeds the common
                degrees of probability. In regard to the people, it is divided into two types: the Ominous Lie or
                Terrifying Lie, and the Animating or Encouraging Lie, both being extremely useful on their proper
                occasions. Concerning the Ominous Lie, he provides several rules, one of which is that terrifying
                objects should not be shown to the people too frequently, lest they become desensitized. He asserts that
                it is necessary for the people of England to be frightened with the French King and the Pretender once a
                year, but after that, these threats should be kept in check until the following year. The failure to
                observe this important rule, by bringing out the Raw-head and Bloody-bones on every trivial occasion,
                has led to great indifference among the common folk in recent years.

                As for the Animating or Encouraging Lies, he provides the following rules: they should not far exceed
                the common degrees of probability, and there should be variety in them; the same lie should not be
                insisted upon too persistently. He also advises that the Promissory or Prognosticating Lies should not
                be about short-term events, to avoid the authors experiencing the shame and confusion of being
                contradicted too soon. He examines, by these rules, the well-meant but unfortunate lie of the Conquest
                of France, which lasted nearly twenty years. However, by being too stubbornly upheld, it eventually
                became threadbare and ultimately unsuccessful.

                As to the Prodigious, he has little to advise, but that their Comets, Whales and
                Dragons should be sizeable; their Storms, Tempests,
                and Earthquakes, without the reach of a Day's
                Joumey of a Man and Horse.
                The Seventh Chapter is wholly taken up in an
                Enquiry, Which of the two Parties are the greatest
                Artists in Political Lying. He owns the Tories have
                been better believed of late; but, that the Whigs ha ve
                much the greater Genius's amongst them. He attributes the ill success of the Whig-Party to their
                glutting
                the Market, and retailing too much of a bad
                Commodity at once: When there is too great a quantity of Worms, it is hard to catch Gudgeons. He
                proposes a Scheme for the Recovery of the Credit of the
                Whig Party, which indeed seems to be somewhat
                Chimerical, and does not savour of that sound
                Judgment the Author has shown in the rest of the
                Work. It amounts to this, That the Party should agree
                to vent nothing but Truth for three Months together,
                which will give them Credit for six Months Lying
                afterwards. He owns, that he believes it almost
                impossible to find fit Persons to execute this
                Scheme. Towards the end of the Chapter, he inveighs
                severely against the Folly of Parties, in retaining
                Scoundrels and Men of Low Genius to retail their
                Lyes; such as most of the present News-Writers are,
                who, besides a strong Bent and Inclination towards
                the Profession, seem to be wholly ignorant in the

                The Seventh Chapter is entirely devoted to an inquiry into which of the two political parties are the
                greatest artists in political lying. He admits that the Tories have been more widely believed of late,
                but that the Whigs possess much greater talent. He attributes the poor success of the Whig Party to
                their flooding the market and retailing too much of a bad commodity all at once. When there is an
                overabundance of worms, it is hard to catch gudgeons. He proposes a scheme to restore the credibility of
                the Whig Party, though it seems somewhat fanciful and does not reflect the sound judgment the author has
                shown in the rest of the work. The scheme amounts to this: the party should agree to spread nothing but
                truth for three months, which will then allow them to lie with credibility for six months afterward. He
                acknowledges that he believes it almost impossible to find suitable persons to carry out this scheme.
                Toward the end of the chapter, he strongly criticizes the folly of political parties in hiring
                scoundrels and men of low intelligence to spread their lies, such as most of the current newswriters,
                who, in addition to having a natural bent for the profession, seem to be utterly ignorant of the rules
                of pseudology and not at all qualified for such a serious responsibility.

                much need of their Assistance.
                The Eighth Chapter is a Project for Uniting the
                severa! smaller Corporations of Lyars into one
                Society. It is too tedious to give a full Account of the
                whole Scheme; what is most remarkable is, that this
                Society ought to consist of the Heads of each Party;
                that no Lye is to pass current without their approbation, they being the best Judges of the present
                Exigencies, and what sorts of Lyes are demanded:
                That in such a Corporation there ought to be Men of
                all Professions, that the A.oyov and the wpE1tOV, that
                is, Decency and Probability, may be observed as much
                as possible: That, besides the Persons above mentioned, this Society ought to consist of the hopeful
                Genius's about the Town (of which there are great
                plenty to be picked up in the several Coffee-houses) Travellers, Virtuoso's, Fox-hunters, Jockeys,
                Attomeys, Old Sea-men and Soldiers out of the
                Hospitals of Greenwich and Chelsea. To this Society,
                so Constituted, ought to be committed the sole
                Management ofLying

                In his Eighth Chapter, he discusses some extraordinary geniuses who have appeared in recent years,
                particularly in their disposition towards the miraculous. He advises these hopeful young men to direct
                their talents toward the service of their country, as it is now seen as undignified to use their
                abilities for prodigious fox-chases, horse-races, feats of activity such as driving coaches, jumping,
                running, swallowing peaches, or pulling out whole sets of teeth to clean, especially when their country
                is in such need of their assistance.
                The Eighth Chapter also presents a project for uniting the various smaller corporations of liars into
                one society. It would be too tedious to provide a full account of the entire scheme, but the most
                remarkable part is that this society should consist of the heads of each party. No lie is to pass as
                legitimate without their approval, as they are the best judges of the current exigencies and the types
                of lies that are needed. In such a corporation, there should be men from all professions to ensure that
                decency and probability (the *A.oyov* and the *wpE1tOV*) are observed as much as possible. In addition
                to the aforementioned individuals, this society should include the hopeful geniuses found in various
                coffeehouses, travelers, virtuosos, fox-hunters, jockeys, attorneys, and old sailors and soldiers from
                the hospitals at Greenwich and Chelsea. To this society, properly constituted, should be entrusted the
                sole management of lying.
